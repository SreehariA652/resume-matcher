PROJECTS
Coffee Quality Analysis
• Performed data cleaning using Python libraries (e.g., Pandas) to address missing values and 
inconsistencies.
• Analysed coffee quality patterns with data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
• Conducted correlation analysis to identify key variables influencing quality.
Used Cars Price Analysis
• Implemented web scraping with BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract data from OLX.
• Organized data into structured Pandas data frames and SQL databases for analysis.
• Evaluated price and odometer correlations and created actionable visualizations with Matplotlib.
Interactive Dashboard Development
• Built dynamic dashboards using Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.
• Applied data aggregation, filtering, and interactive visualization techniques.
• Integrated real-time data updates to enhance decision-making processes.
E-commerce Customer Behaviour Prediction
• Extracted product data via web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium) and applied data preprocessing 
(handling missing values, data formatting, feature engineering).
• Stored cleaned data in a relational database (MySQL) and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.
• Trained both supervised and unsupervised models, optimizing performance through hyperparameter 
tuning
Deep Learning-Based Fashion Item Classification
• Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the 
Fashion MNIST dataset.
• Created a Flask-based web application allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions 
from the trained model.
• Implemented image preprocessing (e.g., resizing, normalization) to improve model inference accuracy 
before making predictions.
