EXPERIENCE
Capstone Project – E-commerce Customer 
Behaviour Prediction (KGiSL Microcollege)
Remote | Jan 2025 – Feb 2025
• Extracted product data via web scraping 
(BeautifulSoup, Selenium) and applied data 
preprocessing (handling missing values, data 
formatting, feature engineering).
• Stored cleaned data in a relational database 
(MySQL) and performed exploratory data 
analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, and 
Seaborn.
• Trained both supervised and unsupervised 
models, optimizing performance through 
hyperparameter tuning.
Freelance Data Analyst – Self-Employed
Remote | Jul 2024 – Present
• Built interactive dashboards using Power BI and 
Tableau to analyze pizza sales performance and 
track KPIs across categories. 
• Conducted EDA on sales and customer datasets, 
identifying insights into purchase patterns and 
regional trends.
• Crafted dynamic and interactive Excel 
dashboards leveraging pivot tables, charts, slicers 
and KPIs to visualize and analyze real-time data 
updates.
PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
Deep Learning Fashion Classifier
• Developed a Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images 
from the Fashion MNIST dataset. 
• Created a Flask-based web application allowing 
users to upload images and receive real-time 
predictions from the trained model. 
• Implemented image preprocessing (e.g., resizing, 
normalization) to improve model inference 
accuracy before making predictions.
Used Cars Price Analysis
• Implemented web scraping with BeautifulSoup 
and Selenium to extract data from OLX.
• Organized data into structured Pandas 
dataframes and SQL databases for analysis.
• Evaluated price and odometer correlations and 
created actionable visualizations with Matplotlib.
